# AdventOfCode2024
This repository includes all of my completed coding problems from Advent of Code 2024 as well as the data assigned to me for each problem.

Advent of Code is an annual online event that provides a series of daily programming puzzles during the month of December. Created by Eric Wastl, Advent of Code is designed to be a fun and educational way for developers, engineers, and hobbyists to hone their coding skills, learn new languages, and engage in friendly competition.

Everyone who participates in AoC receives the same coding challenge every day, however, everyone receives different inputs to solve. There is no set way to go about the problems but to keep mine consistent I chose to solve 2024's puzzles using Python.

To read about the problem of each day visit the AoC 2024 website:
