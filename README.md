# AdventOfCode2024
This repository includes all of my completed coding problems from Advent of Code 2024 as well as the data assigned to me for each problem.

Advent of Code is an annual online event that provides a series of daily programming puzzles during the month of December. Created by Eric Wastl, Advent of Code is designed to be a fun and educational way for developers, engineers, and hobbyists to hone their coding skills, learn new languages, and engage in friendly competition.
